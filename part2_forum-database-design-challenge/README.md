###Release 0 : Design the schema

Design a database schema for a forum that meets the requirements.

Use [SQL Designer](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/sql.html) to create your schema.  When you are done, save the XML of your schema and copy it into the source file `forum.md`. Then, take a screenshot of your final schema design, and upload it using a free image-upload service like [Min.us](http://minus.com).  Paste the URL of the screenshot into your source file (before your XML code).
