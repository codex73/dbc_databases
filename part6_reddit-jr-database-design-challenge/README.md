3. Threads belong to one and only one section

##Releases

###Release 0 : Design the schema

Design a database schema for your very own Reddit Jr.  It should meet all the requirements.


Use [SQL Designer](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/sql.html) to create your schema.  When you are done, save the XML of your schema and copy it into the source file `reddit.md`. Then, take a screenshot of your final schema design, and upload it using a free image-upload service like [Min.us](http://minus.com).  Paste the URL of the screenshot into your source file (before your XML code).
